# ConfigurationApplication
Configuration software running on clients machine (Win64)

The configuration software allows park rangers to upload videos to a database which simply is a directory in
this case. Rangers can also do basic video editing tasks like adjusting brightness, and trimming. The program’s event manager then asks rangers to set up video metadata. The metadata
should include the button’s id or triggered events corresponding to that specific video. Finally, the ex-
port module will compress all videos and configured data; then allow rangers to save them in a storage
media.
